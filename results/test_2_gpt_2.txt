Chapter 2 summary: Summarize the most important part of Chapter 2:

(1) The two main components of the project- a business model and a content strategy. These are all going to be built from scratch, and each will be independent and focused.Generate Chapter 3: Chapter 3 is going to be a story of three characters: an ordinary 10-year-old boy who encounters magic, a supernatural girl whose magic allows her to control the elements and fly, and a young, handsome boy who uses his magic to save others in a town. The story tells me it's going to be a pretty easy and enjoyable read. (I feel this was one of the more interesting stories in this book to me. Chapter 3 is an interesting step up from Chapter 2 for me, because in Chapter 2 the story is mostly about two characters with pretty major conflicts.) In chapter 3, the protagonists come across a new kind of magic. We'll get to see where the reader ends up going from here.

To finish this chapter, there are certain people and places in the plot that the protagonist can save – so it gets a bit tricky.

For Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, we'll also keep an open-ended structure, giving the reader the impression that the future will have a lot of characters (or more), but none of them are very interesting. But for Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, the idea for the story is to see what happens during these chapters. The goal here is to build character arcs.

(2) The content. This chapter contains two major parts:

· Story flow - in between these four chapters. It's a big story with lots of action, but the story doesn't necessarily have to be super exciting to do well, so let's not let that deter us.

· Character arc – basically, let's say we finished on

Chapter 3 summary: Summarize the most important part of Chapter 3:

I am a person who cares about the world in large doses.

What is needed here is not only a new way of thinking about the world with the same approach as that whichGenerate Chapter 4: a new paradigm for how we view stories of power and knowledge.

I am concerned with how we find meaning in the chaos and madness of nature.

We need a new understanding of power, where it becomes less a tool for survival, and more the instrument of change.

These ideas and concepts, which will build the framework for Chapter 4 are currently being worked on behind the scenes. As part of the Phase Two of the project, we will be using technology like the Raspberry Pi as a computer that is able to upload data to the cloud - that is, upload videos to the cloud to edit and upload the stories of powers and knowledge we wish to show. We are already in Phase Two of phase two, so it should happen more soon, but if this idea turns out to be successful, this phase could be the precursor for a second phase in which we begin doing real life content production, as mentioned on the Kickstarter page. We should be able to make content and begin building it ourselves, rather than relying on companies or organizations like HBO that sell content. We are also experimenting with Kickstarter in ways different from anything we have used before, and I would like to thank you for your interest in joining us in this unique project. I am also excited to hear your thoughts and ideas! The process is moving fast and I want
